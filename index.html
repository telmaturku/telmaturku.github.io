           <h2>Who am I?</h2>
     
        <p>Hello, my name is Telma Turku and I'm a student in Haaga-Helia. <br> I study Business Information Technology. <br> I live in Tapiola, in Espoo and I have always lived there. <br> I have been working alongside my studies since I was 16. <br> I'm very outgoing and social. I graduated from Haukilahden lukio in 2023 <br> and I had a gap year after that. I worked a lot and also travelled a lot <br> in Asia and Central America during that year. I have one big brother and <br> I am really close with my family. I have a lot of good friends <br> and close ones that I am really grateful for.</p>
        
        <h3>My interests</h3>

        <p>I enjoy spending time with my close ones. <br> I like to travel a lot and I have many <br> places on my bucket list that I hope I get to visit. <br> I have planned to move abroad after graduating. I would like to <br> live abroad at least a few years to expirience new things. <br> I enjoy going out to eat, doing different sports and just <br> doing things that make me happy. I love to be around my close ones but <br> I also like to have some alone time sometimes. <br> For example, watching series and chilling by myself. <br> I like my current job that much that it is always nice work there <br> and it never feels bad to go there. Main reason for that are the customers. They are <br> mainly regulars. I have known most of them since I started. <br> It is always nice to catch up with them and it feels great to see them excited <br> to see me every week. </p>
    

        <h4>Why should you hire me?</h4>

        <p>I have a lot of experience in customer service. I enjoy learning new <br> and I adapt quickly to new. I'm very social <br> and I get along with different types of people easily. <br> I like challenges and I'm used to working under pressure. <br>  I can also speak many languages and I always do my best. <br> Get to know me better as an employee from my resume.</p>

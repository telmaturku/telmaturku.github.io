        <h1>My resume</h1>
    <p>I started working part-time when I was 16 and have been working part-time ever since. <br> Before that I only had experience from childcare, animal care and school internship weeks. <br> I am really lucky that I have had a part-time job since I was 16. It has allowed me to <br> make money and, for example, travel. It has also worked well alongside high school and other studies.</p>

    <h2>My current experience</h2>
    <p>I work at Tapiolan Tennispuisto as a receptionist. I work there as a regular. <br> I have worked there for about 2 and a half years and I love the place. I sell caf√© products, accept payments for tennis reservations, <br> book tennis reservations and take care of everything related to tennis and equipment. <br> I also do social media for our company. Since starting studies in Haaga-Helia, I have only done 1-2 shifts a week <br> but before that I did about 40 hours per week. Familiar players week after week make this work <br> enoyable and meaningful. Especially now that I dont see them so often, <br> it is heart warming to see them excited when they see me there. I am going to work there a lot more <br> during my summer vacation from school and then after that I will go back to only doing 1-2 shifts a week again.</p>

    <h3>My past experience</h3>
    <p>My first part-time job was Jungle Juice Bar. I worked in Redi, in Kalasatama. <br> I started the job in the beginning of 2021 when I was doing my first year in high school <br> I stopped working there in 2023. I got my current job in the beginning of 2023 so <br> I worked both jobs at the same time for a few months before I decided to only keep my current one. <br> Jungle Juice Bar was a customer service job. I made smoothies there. <br> I did about 10-15 hours per week there for those 2 years. It was a good first part-time job. <br> I also worked in Hirsala Golf for one summer in 2021. I was taking care of the golf courses. <br> As I mentioned, in addition I have done animal care and childcare when I was around 14-15 years old. <br> In middle school we also had those week-long internships. I worked as a school assistant <br> for a week at an elementary school and a week at a cafe.</p>

    <h4>Languages and skills</h4>
    <p>I speak Finnish as my native language. I also speak English fluently. <br> In addition I know the basics of Swedish, German and Spanish. <br> I like to challenge myself, so I enjoy practicing at work to speak different languages more fluently. <br> I hvae 5 years of experience in customer service. I can read situations <br> and work under pressure. I get along with all kinds of people and I also handle challenging situations well. <br> I can use many different cash register systems and I adapt quickly to new.</p>

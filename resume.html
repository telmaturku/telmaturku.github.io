        <h1>My resume</h1>
    <p>I started working part-time when I was 16 and have been working part-time ever since. <br> Before that I only had experience from childcare, animal care and school internship weeks. <br> I am really lucky that I have had a part-time job since I was 16. It has allowed me to <br> make money and, for example, travel. It has also worked well alongside high school and other studies.</p>

    <h2>My current experience</h2>
    <p>I work at Tapiolan Tennispuisto as a receptionist. I work there as a regular. <br> I have worked there for about 2 and a half years and I love the place. I sell caf√© products, accept payments for tennis reservations, <br> book tennis reservations and take care of everything related to tennis and equipment. <br> I also do social media for our company. Since starting studies in Haaga-Helia, I have only done 1-2 shifts a week <br> but before that I did about 40 hours per week. Familiar players week after week make this work <br> enoyable and meaningful. Especially now that I dont see them so often, <br> it is heart warming to see them excited when they see me there. I am going to work there a lot more <br> during my summer vacation from school and then after that I will go back to only doing 1-2 shifts a week again.</p>
